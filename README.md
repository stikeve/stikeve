# Hi, I’m Ashutosh Gautam 👋  
Software Engineer | MSc in Software Engineering @ University of Limerick  
Building things that don’t break (often) and debugging things that definitely do.

I’m a developer who enjoys solving real problems with code, caffeine, and the occasional stack overflow tab.  
I’ve shipped features, squashed bugs, and survived Jira story grooming sessions with dignity intact.  
My professional playground includes:

- JavaScript/TypeScript for slick frontend magic (React, Tailwind, the usual suspects)  
- Node.js, Java Spring Boot, and Python when it’s time to get backend serious  
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL—if it stores data, I’ve probably poked at it  
- Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP—yes, I’ve been in the cloud, and yes, I came back with logs  
- A healthy obsession with performance tuning, clean architecture, and making code that’s actually nice to read  

### A few highlights:
- 🛠 Built microservices that didn’t crash under pressure  
- 🧠 Wrote a dissertation comparing JS frameworks so you don’t have to  
- 🐞 Debugged code like a detective on a caffeine high  
- 🤝 Contributed to retrospectives without falling asleep  

Currently open to new software engineering opportunities where I can keep learning, building, and laughing at my own Git jokes.

**PS:** I bring the full stack. Batteries included. No sponsorship required.  

**PPS:** Why did the function stop calling?  
Because it had too many arguments.
